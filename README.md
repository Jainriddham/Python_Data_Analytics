Key Learnings : 
   1. OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) : Real-time processing for transactions such as hotel bookings, cancellations, and payments. Itâ€™s the operational database used 
                                               for day-to-day activities.
   2. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)    : Analyzing historical data for decision-making, involving complex queries and aggregations to gain insights.
   3. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)         : Processes involving extracting data from various sources (like CSV files), transforming it (cleaning, structuring), and 
                                               loading it into a data warehouse.
   4. Data Warehouse                         : A centralized repository that stores data from different sources, optimized for querying and reporting.
   5. Data Understanding CSV Files           : Understanding the data stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, which contain tabular data. Fact vs. Dimension Tables, Star vs. Snowflake Schema: Fact Table: Contains transactional data (e.g., bookings, revenue) and connects to dimension tables. Dimension Table: Holds descriptive information (e.g., hotel details, customer profiles). Star Schema: A data modeling technique where the fact table is at the center, connected to dimension tables. Snowflake Schema: An extension of the star schema, where dimension tables are further normalized.
   6. Data Exploration                       : Analyzing the data to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies. This step helps identify insights.
   7. Data Cleaning                          : Preparing the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Clean data ensures accurate analysis.
   8. Data Transformation                    : Converting data into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve aggregating, joining, or reshaping data.
   9. Insights Generation                    : Deriving actionable insights from the cleaned and transformed data. These insights guide decision-making.
